# Welcome

Hi, I am **Justin Chin Cheong**, a diligent engineering student who takes pride in my organisational skills and commitment to my work. My thirst for knowledge has continuously driven me to push beyond my limits in everything I do.

I attend **The Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences**, pursuing a degree in **Mechatronics Systems Engineering**. I not only have a **1.1 GPA** but have developed a number of projects which I am hosting here to share my learning journey.

> *Note: I developed this site recently, but many of the projects shown were created earlier.*
