title: Planar Multibody Dynamics Simulations
description: A general purpose simulator for the kinematics and dynamics of two dimensional multibody systems.
  Heavily inspired by the work of Javad N. Nikravesh, Planar Multibody Dynamics. I started it as part of a course on multibody dynamics in my university Hoschule Rhein-Waal, but I have since continuously improved it. Unlike Nikravhesh, this project uses the MATLAB symbolic toolbox to generalise formulations and also increases the accuracy of calculations at a marginal decrease in speed.
skills: 
  - MATLAB
  - Multibody Dynamics
  - Numerical Methods

## 🔧 Current Features

- Core functions for dynamics using the **body coordinate formulation**  
  *(see the `Functions/` directory)*
- General-purpose scripts for simulating multibody systems  
  *(see the `BC_Formulation/` directory)*
- Example simulations of two mechanisms from Nikravesh's text
