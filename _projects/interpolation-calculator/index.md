title: Interpolation Calculator
description: Designing a automatic calculator which can calculate and plot the cubic splines and interpolated polynomials of a given set of univariate data.
  Inspired by the lectures of [Prof. Dr. Achim Kehrein](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en/user/7351) on Numerical Mathematics. 
skills: 
  - MATLAB
  - Multibody Dynamics
  - Numerical Methods

## ðŸ”§ Current Features
- Cubic spline interpolation from a set of data points (either clamped or natural, just change the flag variable)
- Polynomial interpolation from a set of data points (using [Newton's Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_polynomial))
- Plots of both interpolations on the same axes for comparison
- Polynomial interpolation of 3 points (using [Lagrange's Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial)) in Python

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Python (only for Lagrange Interpolater)

## ðŸš§ Future Work
- Implementing cubic spline and newton interpolaters in Python and generalising the lagrange interpolater.
