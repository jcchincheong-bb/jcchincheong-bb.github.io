title: Robotic Simulations
description: Simulating a robotic arm in 2D and 3D to test kinematic controller designs.
  Draws a lot of content from my other project on [Planar Mulitbody Dynamics](https://github.com/jcchincheong-bb/MBD_Simulations) where I developed general purpose 2D simulations. 
skills: 
  - MATLAB
  - Python
  - PyBullet
  - Simulink

## ðŸ”§ Current Features
- Basic 2D kinematic simulation using the **body coordinate formulation**  

<imge src='https://github.com/jcchincheong-bb/RoboticArm_Simulations/blob/main/src/assets/RobArm.png' width='250'>

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Symbolic Math Toolbox 

## ðŸš§ Future Work
- 2D: Implementation of kinetic analyses (e.g., forward and inverse dynamics) + Animations
- 3D: Implementation of kinematic and kinetic analysis in Simscape and/or PyBullet
