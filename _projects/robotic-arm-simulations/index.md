Simulating a robotic arm in 2D and 3D to test kinematic controller designs.

Draws a lot of content from my other project on [Planar Mulitbody Dynamics](https://github.com/jcchincheong-bb/MBD_Simulations) where I developed general purpose 2D simulations. 

The goal here is to create efficient 2D and 3D simulations in order to model a controller for the robotic arm.

> **Note 01.08.2025:** The current prototype gives nonsense results and there isn't much else, but I will be working on it in the next few weeks. Have fun watching along!

## ðŸ”§ Current Features
- Basic 2D kinematic simulation using the **body coordinate formulation**  

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Symbolic Math Toolbox 

## ðŸš§ Future Work
- 2D: Implementation of kinetic analyses (e.g., forward and inverse dynamics) + Animations
- 3D: Implementation of kinematic and kinetic analysis in Simscape and/or PyBullet
